				I'm still not sure what to write here. Would it be my achievements? Or would it be my personality, likes and dislikes?  I have so many things in my mind but I'm not really sure which of them the employer needs to know the most. So I'll go ahead and write the first thing that comes in my mind.

				Climbing trees was my best hobby when I was little. I like to believe that I'll always be able to do that not only physically but also mentally and emotionally. I believe I can treat every obstacle in life as a new tree that I can always come over with consistency, perserverance and a lot of fun!
